Understand occupancy trends and cancellation behaviors.

Provide filters and drilldowns for flexible business analysis.

ðŸ“Š Business Impact & Insights
The dashboard revealed the following critical insights:

Mumbai was the top revenue-generating city, while Delhi, despite the highest occupancy (>60%), generated the least revenue.

Weekend occupancy is consistently higher â€“ a potential area to maximize revenue.

70% of bookings are successful check-outs, while 5% are no-shows.

Cancellation analysis is vital, as a significant number of bookings are canceled before check-in.

Average stay duration is 2.4 days, and customer ratings range between 3.4 to 3.8 â€“ performance can be benchmarked against industry standards.
